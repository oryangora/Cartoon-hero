    <h1>Captian Planet and The Planeteers</h1>
    <h2>SHOW MYTHOLOGY</h2>
    <p>In the original mythology of the show as imagined by Pyle, Captain Planet was intended to represent more of a metaphor of what is possible when kids work together to solve problems. The show wasn’t about calling up a savior. It was about empowering children to use their own abilities.</p>

    <h3>GAIA</h3>
    <img src="/Gaia.png" alt="Gaia">
    <p>The beautiful spirit of Earth, Gaia is the protector of the planet. She feels anguish whenever damage is done to the world, its seas, its atmosphere, or to any living creature. When damage occurs, Gaia spurs the Planeteers into action– kind of an “Eco-Alert Early Warning System.”

        The archetypal Earth mother, gaia is a source of wisdom and advice for both Captain Planet and the Planeteers. She helps the identify environmental problems via a series of crystalline screens located on her home base, Hope Island. These “monitors” track the events of the present and can predict their outcome if left unchecked. But no matter what happens, Gaia loves Earth’s children unconditionally. Though sorrow by what they’ve done and worried about the future, she is eternally hopeful that all will turn out for the best.</p>

    <img src="/Linka.png" alt="Linka">
    <p>A hardworking, far-too-serious 16-year-old who’s straight from eastern Europe, Linka’s the most conservative Planeteer.

Wheeler’s biggest challenge is to become more sensitive to others and to learn that the end doesn’t justify the means. Always ready with a glib remark, he sometimes speaks up at inopportune times.  Wheeler me be impetuous, but he has a good heart, and in the end, he usually makes things right.

    <img src="/Ma-Ti.png" alt="MA-TI">
    <p>This 13-year-old South American may be the youngest Planeteer, but he often seems wisest. Raised by Kayapo Indians, Ma-Ti can survive in the wildest jungle. He’s no stranger to the big city either, and he knows a lot about the world outside the Amazon basin. Ma-Ti has an intuitive grasp of ecological principles. And he’s willing to give of himself for the benefit of the whole.

        The essence of caring and concern, Ma-Ti serves as the Planeteers’ emotional link to the Earth and humankind. He’s also the closest of the group to Gaia, and tries to keep the Planeteers focused on the spirit of her teachings. Ma-Ti often acts as a cohesive force, working to promote Planeteer unity.
        
        Ma-Ti’s element is HEART, which enables him to communicate telepathically with other Planeteers and with Gaia. He can also communicate with animals, and his empathetic abilities allow him to feel emotions that provide valuable clues during the Planeteers adventures.</p>
